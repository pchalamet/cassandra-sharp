NOTE
====
I've stopped working on this driver. For better support, please gear towards the official [.net Cassandra driver](https://github.com/datastax/csharp-driver).

cassandra-sharp - high performance .NET driver for Apache Cassandra
===================================================================
![build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/pchalamet/cassandra-sharp?branch=master)

The philosophy of cassandra-sharp is to be really simple and fast: no Linq provider, no complex API. Just CQL, simple object mapping and great performance :)

With version 4, cassandra-sharp is only speaking native protocol 4 - basically, this means you are required to use Cassandra 3.

cassandra-sharp supports async operations exposed as Rx subscriptions or TPL tasks. Efficient memory usage can be achieve using the push model of Rx.

A command line tool is also available (cqlplus) to access a Cassandra cluster. It's also a great tool to understand what's happening under the cover.

Getting binaries
================
Binaries are available through NuGet : http://www.nuget.org/packages/cassandra-sharp

Features
========
* async operations (TPL tasks / Rx subscriptions)
* Rx interface (IObservable / IObserver) for result streaming
* TPL Task for future operations
* Linq friendly
* extensible rowset mapping (poco and map provided out of the box)
* blazing fast object marshaler (dynamic gen'ed code)
* robust connection handling (connection recovery supported)
* ability to understand performance issues (client and server side)
* multiple extension points
* command line tool (cqlplus)
* .NET 4.0+ support (Microsoft .NET / Mono)

How to build
============
To build cassandra-sharp, load cassandra-sharp.sln in Visual Studio 2017.
To build from command line and to regenerate thrift proxy, use Build.cmd.

Sample configuration
====================
```xml
<configSections>
	<section name="CassandraSharp" type="CassandraSharp.SectionHandler, CassandraSharp.Interfaces" />
</configSections>

<CassandraSharp>
	<Cluster name="TestCassandra">
		<Endpoints>
			<Server>localhost</Server>
		</Endpoints>
	</Cluster>
</CassandraSharp>
```
Sample client
=============
```c#
public class SchemaKeyspaces
{
    public string KeyspaceName { get; set; }
    public bool DurableWrites { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, string> Replication { get; set; }
}
	
public static class Sample
{
    private static void DisplayKeyspace(SchemaKeyspaces ks)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("KeyspaceName={0} DurableWrites={1} Class={2} ReplicationFactor={3}",
                          ks.KeyspaceName,
                          ks.DurableWrites,
                          ks.Replication["class"],
                          ks.Replication["replication_factor"]);
    }
	
    public static async Task QueryKeyspaces()
    {
        XmlConfigurator.Configure();
        using (ICluster cluster = ClusterManager.GetCluster("TestCassandra"))
        {
            var cmd = cluster.CreatePocoCommand();
            const string cqlKeyspaces = "SELECT * from system_schema.keyspaces";

            // async operation with streaming
            cmd.WithConsistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.ONE)
               .Execute<SchemaKeyspaces>(cqlKeyspaces)
               .Subscribe(DisplayKeyspace);

            // future
            var kss = await cmd.Execute<SchemaKeyspaces>(cqlKeyspaces).AsFuture();
            foreach (var ks in kss)
                DisplayKeyspace(ks);
        }

        ClusterManager.Shutdown();
    }
}
```
